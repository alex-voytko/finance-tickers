## Not implemented:

### Testing

- Need more time to learn it, sorry, I've never did it. I've already started, but it will pay more time than I expected, need mentoring.

### Specifing interval time by user

- I really can implement it, but don't think that this possibility is very important for user. I will leave it for the end after successful testing implementation.
